\section{Overview}

The analysis of data provided by the GRIFFIN array is done using a ROOT based program called GRSISort.
The source code for GRSISort is written in C++ and contains many classes to assist with the analysis of data from a nuclear spectroscopic experiment.
This guide is intended to help analyists to produce human readable sprectrums using GRSISort.

Generally, data analysis will take the following form,
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Sorting the MIDAS data produced from the experiment and producing fragment trees and analysis trees (stored in .root files)
\item
Applying corrections to data.
This includes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Linear Gain Matching
\item
Cross Talk
\item
Non-linear gain matching (aka Residuals)
\end{enumerate}
\item
Producing a final .root file that contains histograms and matricies for analysizing spectra
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Conventions used in this doccument}

When a snippit of code begins with the \texttt{\$} character ismeans to run it in a shell prompt, or coded into a bash script. Lines begining with \texttt{GRSI []} are intended to be used with GRSISort's CLang interpriter, and similarly can be used in \texttt{.cxx} scripts.
Files that end in \texttt{.cxx} should have a compiled portion can be called by \texttt{\$ <name>}.

\section{Data Analysis}

\subsection{First sort of data}
First we must sort our data, this can be acomplished with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
$  grsisort -laq -suppress-errors -is-correcting-cross-talk -sort-depth=70000000 /dir/to/midas/file
\end{lstlisting}

See the GRSISort wiki for an explanation of the flags used.
If we have already have rough gain match, we can apply it in the above method by appending the appropirate \texttt{.cal} file to the command above.

\subsection{Applying a strict linear gain match}

This step is important for setting up the next few corrections.
Using \texttt{kLinearGainMatch.cxx} we need to gain match two of our strongest peaks.
These will become our base-line points for generating the energy residuals.
Line 60 need to be changed to reflect the energy of the gamma rays used for calibration.

Afterwords, examine the energy calibration matrix to ensure the peaks used for calibration have the same energy.
This can be acomplished using something such as:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
GRSI [] AnalysisTree->Draw("TGriffin.fGriffinLowGainHits.GetEnergy():TGriffin.fGriffinLowGainHits.GetChannel().fNumber>>h(64,0,64,4000,0,4000)","TSceptar.GetMultiplicity()>0","colz")
\end{lstlisting}

To get a more comprehesive overview, \texttt{kMakeCalMatricies.cxx} can be used to generate a \texttt{.root} file containing other diagnostic histograms and matricies.

\subsection{Calculating Residuals}

For this step we will use the script \texttt{kResidualCalculator.cxx}.
This scripts takes any number of calibration peaks to calculate what the true response is of the detector.
Energies should be selected from well known literature values, but the more peaks used for this calibration, the better.
The energies should be hard coded into lines \$\$.

After running the script, the \texttt{TSpines}/\texttt{TGraphs} will be saved in the analyzed \texttt{.root} file, including a \texttt{TCanvas} object that shows a summary of each crystal. To access the residuals, use something similar to the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++,numbers=left, xleftmargin=5.0ex,caption=Example residual code for loading residuals]
    if( gFile->cd("Energy_Residuals") ) {
        printf("Energy residual calibration data found. Loading...\n");

        TGraph* TempResidual;
        for( int i = 1 ; i <= 64 ; i++ ) {
            gDirectory->GetObject(Form("Graph;%d",i), TempResidual);
            pGriff->LoadEnergyResidual( i-1, TempResidual);
        }
        gFile->cd(); // Return to the top directory
        printf("Done.\n");
\end{lstlisting}

For examples of use, see scripts like \texttt{LeanMatricies.cxx} in which the script has been split up into two sections of code.
One within the outer main function, and then within the inner main function, and the residuals are stored in a \texttt{TSpline} vector.
When working with selector scripts, the code snippit has been placed in the \texttt{InitializeBranches} member function of the selector class, within the corrisponding \texttt{.h} file.

\subsection{Cross Talk Corrections \protect\footnote{Addopted from Kevin Ortner} }

Now that we have nicely callibrated energies, we can now compute our CT coefficents that will be stored in a \texttt{.cal} file.
We will then use this calibration file when we resort our data.
To compute the coefficents, we will use a selector class which uses the two prominent transitions from ${^{60}}$Co.
These files are normally excituted using a command in bash such as,
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
 $ grsiproof  {rootfile}.root /path/to/selector.C
 \end{lstlisting}
This command will generate a file called  \lstinline{ct_coefficients.cal}, we then input this file into \texttt{GriffinCTFix.cxx} through the following method:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
 $ GriffinCTFix CrossTalk.root <name>.cal
  \end{lstlisting}
Which spits out a cal file called \texttt{<name>.cal}. We can ether load this file directly into our \texttt{.root} using,
\begin{lstlisting}[language=c++]
 GRSI [] TChannel::ReadCalFile("ct_correction.cal")
 GRSI [] TChannel::WriteToRoot()
\end{lstlisting}
Otherwise, the above can be setup to automatically happen in \texttt{GriffinCTFix.cxx} by adding the above code to the last lines of the main function.
